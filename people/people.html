                    <p>Graduate Biomedical Engineer with concentration in biomedical micro-technology. Working on the
                        characterization of carbon platforms by plasma treatment for biosensors with the research team
                        of Dr. Samira Hosseini has been an amazing experience, throughout the whole process I have
                        learned all the research steps and methodology used to go from the idea to the write of the
                        paper, also I had the big opportunity to work with so many characterizations techniques that are
                        used now a days in the area of research such as water contact angle, atomic force microscopy,
                        scanning electron microscopy and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.</p>

                        previously worked at FEMSA laboratory as a research assistant and at Writing Lab as assistant
                        director, where she developed the database for its website, entailing, among other things,
                        sourcing and analyzing information from 32 subjects, over 700 journals, and more than 150
                        conferences. She has also participated as coordination staff for two consecutive years at the
                        International Congress of Innovation Education (CIIE), and as a host at INCmty. She has been
                        published as a first author in a book chapter from the Encyclopedia of Analytical Science called
                        “Radioimmuniassays and Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay”, and worked in collaboration among
                        different research papers, from the subjects of BioMEMS to education, and conference
